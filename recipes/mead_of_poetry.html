            <p>Strictly speaking this is not one of Odin&apos;s recipe, but rather one from Fjalar and Galar. But it is one of Odin&apos;s favourites, and if it wasn&apos;t for him drinking so much of it that some leaked out of his butt "skáldfífla hlutr" (the Rhymester's share), humankind would not have any poets</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Kill Kvasir*</li>
                <li>Squeeze Kvasir to extract all of his blood</li>
                <li>Pour Kvasir&apos;s blood into 2 vats called Boðn, Són and a bowl called Óðrerir.</li>
                <li>Mix in some honey</li>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Anyone who drinks this will become a poet or scholar</li>
                <li>If someone called Bölverk offers to do some work in exchange for a drink of this, don&apos;t try to trick him, he&apos;s actually Odin and will trick you back and drink the whole lot if you do this and you'll be left having to try and get some of the stuff that leaks out of his butt.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
